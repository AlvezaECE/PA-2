- Import numpy was used for array operations and numberical computations 
- np.arange was(1, 101) was used to generate an array that contains integers 1 to 100.
- I used reshape(10, 10) to reshape the array into a 10x10.
- Ive also realized that we can use .mean() and .std() for element-wise mean and standard deviation, instead of inputting individual formulas.
